This document specifies Endstate Hosted Backup — the optional paid tier, publicly named Endstate Cloud, that allows users to upload encrypted profile backups to Endstate-operated infrastructure and restore them on any machine.

This contract is referenced by three repositories:

- `endstate` (engine, Go) — implements client-side encryption, CLI commands, and JWT validation
- `endstate-gui` (Tauri/React) — wires GUI flows to engine commands
- `substrate` (Next.js/Vercel) — implements the backend API, auth, metadata, and storage orchestration

If repository code conflicts with this contract, code wins for the immediate task and a contract update must be proposed in the same change. Silent drift is forbidden.

---

## 1. Trust Model

Endstate cannot decrypt user data uploaded to Hosted Backup. This is a structural property, not a policy. Even with full access to our servers and a court order, we have no path to your data.

The user's passphrase never leaves their device. On the client, the passphrase is processed by Argon2id with a per-user salt to produce 64 bytes of derived material. The first 32 bytes are sent to the server as `serverPassword` and stored as a normal password hash. The second 32 bytes — `masterKey` — never leave the device, and are used to wrap the per-user data-encryption-key (DEK) that encrypts file contents.

The server authenticates the user without seeing material that could decrypt their data.

If a user loses both their passphrase and their recovery key, their data is unrecoverable. Endstate cannot recover it. This is the cost of the structural guarantee.

### What this design protects against

- External attacker who breaches the database, the storage backend, or both
- Insider with full operator access at Endstate
- Subpoena, court order, or compelled assistance under any legal regime

### What this design does not protect against

- Compromise of the user's device — full local access defeats end-to-end encryption
- Weak user passphrase — Argon2id raises the cost of offline attack but does not eliminate it
- Side-channel attacks on the client during active use
- Data the user has uploaded unencrypted somewhere else

### GUI / client responsibility

Recovery key generation, presentation, and verification are mandatory parts of the signup flow — not optional steps a user can skip. Any client implementing this contract (the official GUI, a hypothetical CLI signup, or a third-party client) MUST offer at least two save formats (file and printable PDF) and require explicit confirmation that the user has saved the recovery key before signup completes.

---

## 2. KDF Parameters (locked v1)

All key derivation uses Argon2id (RFC 9106) with the following parameters:

| Parameter     | Value              | Rationale                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Algorithm     | Argon2id           | Memory-hard, side-channel-resistant; current OWASP recommendation  |
| Memory        | 65536 KiB (64 MiB) | OWASP 2024 minimum for password derivation                         |
| Iterations    | 3                  | OWASP 2024 minimum                                                 |
| Parallelism   | 4                  | Balance between desktop-class hardware utilisation and server load |
| Output length | 64 bytes           | 32 bytes serverPassword + 32 bytes masterKey                       |
| Salt length   | 16 bytes           | Per-user, generated at signup, stored on server, returned at login |

The salt is treated as non-secret. The server returns it to the client during the login pre-handshake so the client can derive `serverPassword` and `masterKey` consistently across machines.

**Parameter negotiation:** The login pre-handshake response includes a `kdf` object specifying the parameters that were used at signup. The client uses these parameters, not its own defaults. This allows future upgrades without breaking existing accounts.

**Parameter floor:** The server rejects any signup using parameters weaker than the v1 values above. The client refuses to derive keys with parameters below the v1 floor regardless of server response.

---

## 3. Encryption Envelope Format

Each encrypted backup version is structured as a manifest plus chunks. Chunks are uploaded and downloaded independently to support resume.

### Manifest (encrypted JSON)

```json
{
  "envelopeVersion": 1,
  "versionId": "<uuid>",
  "createdAt": "<ISO 8601>",
  "originalSize": 0,
  "chunkSize": 4194304,
  "chunkCount": 0,
  "chunks": [{ "index": 0, "encryptedSize": 0, "sha256": "<hex>" }],
  "kdf": {
    "algorithm": "argon2id",
    "memory": 65536,
    "iterations": 3,
    "parallelism": 4
  },
  "wrappedDEK": "<base64>"
}
```

The manifest itself is encrypted with the DEK before upload, using the same AES-256-GCM scheme as chunks. The server stores the encrypted manifest blob; chunk metadata (index, encryptedSize, sha256) is also tracked in the database for integrity checks but the manifest is the source of truth.

The manifest's AAD when encrypted is the 4-byte big-endian unsigned value `0xFFFFFFFF` — a sentinel chosen because no real chunk index will ever take this value. This binds the encrypted manifest to the "manifest" role and prevents it being decrypted as if it were chunk index 0.

### Chunk format (AES-256-GCM, RFC 5116)

| Field        | Size     | Contents                                           |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `nonce`      | 12 bytes | Random per chunk, generated client-side via CSPRNG |
| `ciphertext` | variable | Encrypted plaintext                                |
| `tag`        | 16 bytes | GCM authentication tag                             |

Plaintext chunk size is fixed at 4 MiB except for the final chunk. Each chunk is encrypted independently with a freshly generated random nonce. The chunk index (4-byte big-endian unsigned integer) is included as Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) to bind chunks to their position and prevent reordering attacks.

### DEK wrapping

The DEK is a 32-byte random value generated client-side at signup using a CSPRNG. It is wrapped with AES-256-GCM using `masterKey` as the wrapping key. The wrapped DEK is stored in the manifest. Only the client can unwrap it.

### Algorithm choice rationale

- AES-256-GCM is hardware-accelerated on all modern CPUs (AES-NI), well-audited (NIST SP 800-38D), and the dominant choice in comparable products (Bitwarden, Filen, AWS S3 SSE-C)
- 4 MiB chunk size balances upload resume granularity against per-chunk overhead. Standard Notes uses 1 MiB; Filen uses ~5 MiB. 4 MiB is a defensible middle.
- GCM authentication tags prevent tampering; AAD binding to chunk index prevents reordering

---

## 4. JWT Format

Authentication tokens are JWTs signed with EdDSA (Ed25519) per RFC 8032 and RFC 8037.

**Why EdDSA:** Smaller signatures than RSA, no parameter choice ambiguity, and the substrate codebase already has the `@noble/ed25519` library wired and tested for license signing. Reusing this keypair pattern reduces new attack surface.

### Header

```json
{ "alg": "EdDSA", "typ": "JWT", "kid": "<key id>" }
```

### Claims

| Claim                 | Type   | Description                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `iss`                 | string | Issuer URL — `https://substratesystems.io` for Endstate Cloud, the self-host URL otherwise                    |
| `sub`                 | string | User ID (UUID)                                                                                                |
| `aud`                 | string | `endstate-backup`                                                                                             |

| `nbf`                 | int    | Not-before, equal to `iat`                                                                                    |
| `jti`                 | string | JWT ID (UUID) for revocation lookup                                                                           |
| `subscription_status` | string | One of `none`, `active`, `grace`, `cancelled` — UI hint only, server is authoritative for write authorisation |

### Browser-session token (audience `endstate-account`)

A short-lived (60 seconds) bearer credential minted by `POST /api/auth/browser-session` (§5) when an authenticated GUI client requests a web handoff to the substrate `/account` portal. Carried only in the `?session=` URL parameter on the first hit to `/account/start`; substrate's redeem path burns the `jti` and issues an HttpOnly cookie session for subsequent interactions.

The token uses the same EdDSA infrastructure as access tokens (`kid` rotation aware, JWKS-verifiable). The audience claim is enforced server-side: it is NOT a refresh token, NOT a recovery token, and NOT usable for `/api/backups/*` calls.

| Claim | Type   | Description                                                              |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `iss` | string | Same as access token                                                     |
| `sub` | string | User ID (UUID)                                                           |
| `aud` | string | `endstate-account`                                                       |
| `iat` | int    | Issued-at                                                                |
| `exp` | int    | `iat + 60`                                                               |
| `nbf` | int    | Equal to `iat`                                                           |
| `jti` | string | Single-use; burned at redeem (replays return `BROWSER_SESSION_CONSUMED`) |

### JWKS endpoint

`GET /api/.well-known/jwks.json` returns the public key set in standard JWKS format. The current signing key is identified by `kid`. Multiple keys may be present during rotation.

### JWT lifecycle

Access tokens expire after 15 minutes. Clients use the refresh token to obtain a new access token. JWT is never used for encryption-key derivation — encryption keys are derived solely from the user's passphrase.

---

## 5. Auth Flow

Five endpoints. All endpoints accept and return JSON. Errors use the standard envelope from `cli-json-contract.md`.

All auth endpoints rate-limited at the substrate edge. Rate limits are documented at implementation time, not in this contract.

### POST /api/auth/signup

**Request:**

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "serverPassword": "<base64, 32 bytes>",
  "salt": "<base64, 16 bytes>",
  "kdfParams": { "algorithm": "argon2id", "memory": 65536, "iterations": 3, "parallelism": 4 },
  "wrappedDEK": "<base64>",
  "recoveryKeyVerifier": "<base64>",
  "recoveryKeyWrappedDEK": "<base64>"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{ "userId": "<uuid>", "accessToken": "<jwt>", "refreshToken": "<opaque>" }
```

The server stores `Argon2id(serverPassword, server_salt)`, the user's `salt`, the `kdfParams`, the `wrappedDEK`, and the recovery key materials. The server never sees the user's passphrase or `masterKey`.

### POST /api/auth/login (step 1: pre-handshake)

**Request:** `{ "email": "user@example.com" }`

**Response:** `{ "salt": "<base64>", "kdfParams": {...} }`

Lets the client derive the same `serverPassword` and `masterKey` it derived at signup. This step leaks "this email exists" to anyone who hits the endpoint — acceptable trade-off, matches the disclosure made by every comparable service. Mitigated by edge rate-limiting.

### POST /api/auth/login (step 2: complete)

**Request:** `{ "email": "user@example.com", "serverPassword": "<base64>" }`

**Response:** `{ "userId": "<uuid>", "accessToken": "<jwt>", "refreshToken": "<opaque>", "wrappedDEK": "<base64>" }`

The server verifies `serverPassword` against the stored hash and returns the wrapped DEK so the client can unwrap it with `masterKey`.

### POST /api/auth/refresh

**Request:** `{ "refreshToken": "<opaque>" }`

**Response:** `{ "accessToken": "<jwt>", "refreshToken": "<opaque>" }`

Sliding window: each refresh issues a new refresh token; the old one is invalidated. Maximum lifetime of a single refresh chain is 30 days.

### POST /api/auth/logout

**Request:** `{ "refreshToken": "<opaque>" }`

**Response:** `{ "ok": true }`

Invalidates the refresh token. Access tokens expire on their own; the server does not maintain an access-token blocklist.

### POST /api/auth/recover

See Section 6.

### POST /api/auth/browser-session

Bearer-authenticated. Mints a single-use 60-second JWT (`aud: endstate-account`) for the GUI to hand off to the substrate `/account` portal.

**Request:** no body.

**Response:**

```json
{ "sessionToken": "<jwt>", "accountUrl": "<issuer>/account/start" }
```

The engine returns the URL + token; it does NOT open a browser. The GUI composes `${accountUrl}?session=${sessionToken}` and opens it in the system browser. Substrate's `/account/start` route validates the token, burns the `jti`, sets an HttpOnly session cookie, and 302s to the cookie-only `/account` page.

Self-hosters override `accountUrl` via `endstate_extensions.account_portal_url` (§9). The fallback is `${issuer}/account/start`.

### POST /api/auth/browser-session/redeem

Substrate-internal. Accepts `{ "token": "<jwt>" }`, validates audience + expiry, burns the `jti`, and returns 204 with `Set-Cookie: endstate_account_session=<opaque>; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=3600`. The `/account/start` route uses the redeem logic directly via the substrate `browser-session` lib; the body-based POST is provided for non-page consumers (parity / future use).

---

## 6. Recovery Key

Generated client-side at signup. Presented to the user once for them to record. Endstate never stores the recovery key in plaintext.

**The recovery key is a second independent unlock path, not a second factor.** Normal sign-in on any machine requires only email and passphrase — the recovery key is not used. The recovery key is a safety net for the case where the user forgets their passphrase.

### Generation

32 bytes from a CSPRNG, encoded as a 24-word BIP39 mnemonic for human readability and transcription error-detection.

### Storage

The recovery key is processed client-side by Argon2id (same parameters as the passphrase KDF) to produce a 32-byte `recoveryKey`. A second wrapping of the DEK with `recoveryKey` — `recoveryKeyWrappedDEK` — is stored on the server alongside `wrappedDEK`. The server stores `Argon2id(recoveryKey, salt)` as a verifier (`recoveryKeyVerifier`).

### Normal sign-in flow

See Section 5. Recovery key is not involved.

### Recovery flow (passphrase forgotten, recovery key in hand)

1. User initiates recovery, enters their recovery key (typed mnemonic or pasted from saved file).
2. Client derives `recoveryKey` via Argon2id (using salt + kdfParams from pre-handshake).
3. Client proves possession to server via `POST /api/auth/recover` with `{ email, recoveryKeyProof }`.
4. Server returns `{ recoveryToken, recoveryKeyWrappedDEK, ttlSeconds }`. The `recoveryToken` is single-use, audience-bound, and is the bearer credential for finalize. `ttlSeconds` is currently `600` (10 minutes); the server is authoritative for expiry but clients may surface this hint to the user.
5. Client unwraps DEK with `recoveryKey` (using `recoveryKeyWrappedDEK`).
6. User is prompted to set a new passphrase.
7. Client generates a fresh 16-byte salt, derives new `serverPassword` and `masterKey` from the new passphrase + fresh salt, re-wraps the DEK as `newWrappedDEK`, and posts to `POST /api/auth/recover/finalize` with:
   - Header: `Authorization: Bearer <recoveryToken>`
   - Body: `{ newServerPassword, newSalt, newKdfParams, newWrappedDEK }`
8. Server verifies the bearer token, atomically updates password hash and wrappedDEK, **invalidates the recoveryToken** (replays return `RECOVERY_TOKEN_EXPIRED`), and returns `{ userId, accessToken, refreshToken, subscriptionStatus }`.

**Recovery token semantics.** The token is single-use: a successful finalize burns it. Replays return `RECOVERY_TOKEN_EXPIRED`. The `ttlSeconds` field is advisory — the server is authoritative for expiry — but lets clients show the user a sensible "you have N minutes" hint without parsing the JWT. The token's audience claim is distinct from the access-token audience, preventing cross-use.

### What the recovery key does not do

It does not allow the server, an attacker who breaches the server, or anyone other than the holder of the recovery key to decrypt the DEK. Both `wrappedDEK` and `recoveryKeyWrappedDEK` are useless without the corresponding passphrase or recovery key.

### What happens if both are lost

Data is unrecoverable. The user's account remains, but blobs are inaccessible. The user can re-subscribe and back up new data; previous data cannot be recovered.

---

## 7. API Surface

All endpoints accept and return JSON. Errors use the standard envelope from `cli-json-contract.md`:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable message",
    "detail": {},
    "remediation": "What to do",
    "docsKey": "errors/error-code"
  }
}
```

All write endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`. Auth endpoints (signup/login/refresh/logout/recover) require no token except `refresh` and `logout`.

All endpoints rate-limited at the substrate edge. Rate limits documented per-endpoint at implementation time.

### Auth endpoints (Section 5)

- `POST /api/auth/signup`
- `POST /api/auth/login` (two-step)
- `POST /api/auth/refresh`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `POST /api/auth/recover` and `POST /api/auth/recover/finalize` (Section 6)

### Account endpoints

- `GET /api/account/me` → `{ userId, email, subscriptionStatus, createdAt, plan, currentPeriodEnd, gracePeriodEndsAt, retentionEndsAt, paddleSubscriptionId, paddleCustomerId }` — bearer-authenticated. `retentionEndsAt` is the authoritative final managed-data deletion deadline during grace or cancellation; clients MUST display it rather than inferring a date from the billing period.
- `DELETE /api/account` → bearer-authenticated; triggers GDPR deletion (Section 12).
- `POST /api/account/web-delete` → **cookie-authenticated** sibling of `DELETE /api/account` for the `/account` web page. Same cascade as the bearer-auth variant; invalidates the account session cookie on completion. The dual surface (bearer + cookie) is deliberate: the engine's bearer flow stays unchanged, and the cookie-auth path serves the in-browser surface without dual-auth on the canonical route.
- `POST /api/account/session/logout` → cookie-authenticated. Invalidates the account session row, clears the cookie, 204.

### Billing endpoints

- `POST /api/billing/checkout` → mint a Paddle transaction for the Hosted Backup price → `{ checkoutUrl, transactionId }`. Engine-initiated (the `backup subscribe` command), bearer-authenticated, no request body — substrate resolves the price server-side. The engine returns `checkoutUrl` to the GUI, which opens it in the system browser (substrate's `/endstate` landing renders the Paddle `_ptxn` overlay); the engine never opens a browser. Like `/api/account/*`, this lives off the issuer host (Section 9), not under `backup_api_base`.
- `POST /api/billing/portal` → cookie-authenticated. Calls Paddle's `POST /customers/:id/portal-sessions` and returns `{ portalUrl }` (Paddle's `urls.general.overview`). Available in `active`, `grace`, and `paused` states. Returns `404 PADDLE_PORTAL_UNAVAILABLE` when the user has no `paddleCustomerId` on file (e.g. pre-first-payment). The cancelled-state path uses `/api/billing/checkout` instead, since Paddle's hosted portal does not reactivate fully-canceled subscriptions.

### Backup metadata endpoints

- `GET /api/backups` → list user's backups: `{ backups: [{ id, name, latestVersionId, versionCount, totalSize, updatedAt }] }`
- `POST /api/backups` → create a new backup: `{ name }` → `{ backupId }`
- `PATCH /api/backups/:backupId` → update a backup's mutable metadata (partial body; today `{ name }`) → `{ id, name, updatedAt }`. The id is immutable identity; only the label changes. Future metadata fields extend the body additively. Same read-access gating as DELETE (see below).
- `DELETE /api/backups/:backupId` → permanently delete a backup and all its versions
- `GET /api/backups/:backupId/versions` → list versions: `{ versions: [{ versionId, createdAt, size, manifestSha256 }] }`
- `POST /api/backups/:backupId/versions` → create a new version: `{ encryptedManifest, chunkMetadata: [{ index, encryptedSize, sha256 }], operationId? }` plus preferred `X-Endstate-Operation-ID` → `{ versionId, uploadUrls: [{ chunkIndex, presignedUrl, expiresAt }], requiresCommit, alreadyCommitted? }`
- `POST /api/backups/:backupId/versions/:versionId/commit` → finalise an uploaded version (see below)
- `DELETE /api/backups/:backupId/versions/:versionId` → soft-delete a version (purged after 7 days)

### Version commit (schema 2.1)

`POST /api/backups/:backupId/versions/:versionId/commit`

**Request:** no body.

**Response:** `{ "versionId": "<uuid>", "committedAt": "<ISO 8601>", "alreadyCommitted": <bool> }`

`alreadyCommitted` is `true` when the version was already committed by an earlier
call; `committedAt` then carries the ORIGINAL timestamp, not the retry's. Clients
MAY ignore both fields — the engine does, treating any 2xx as durable — but a
server MUST return them so a replay is distinguishable from a first commit.

**Access.** Commit requires an active subscription. It is the closing half of a
write, not a management operation, so it is gated exactly like version creation
and is NOT covered by the delete/rename read-access exemption in §10.

Creating a version and uploading its blobs are not the same event. `POST .../versions` mints the row and the presigned URLs; the client then PUTs the encrypted manifest and every chunk directly to object storage, which the server does not observe. The commit call is the client telling the server "every blob for this version is durably stored" — and it is the only signal the server has to that effect. New engines MUST carry a stable operation identity in `X-Endstate-Operation-ID`; the additive body `operationId` is accepted for older callers, but the two values must match when both are present. When discovery advertises `version-create-operation-replay-v1`, a replay with the same principal, backup, operation ID, and identical payload returns the original pending version with fresh checksum- and metadata-bound staging URLs. Before minting them, the server atomically places a replay fence for their full validity window; GC cannot claim the generation while that fence is active. A replay after commit returns HTTP 200 with that `versionId`, `alreadyCommitted: true`, and an empty `uploadUrls` list. A changed payload returns 409 and leaves the stored version untouched. The operation's immutable payload binding and terminal state survive retention soft- and hard-deletion, so delayed replays cannot create a new generation or bypass mismatch validation. While GC owns the pending version through `gc_reclaim_token`, lookup, publication, and URL minting return a retryable failure and produce no URLs.

The server sets `committed_at` and only then applies retention (§8). The endpoint is **idempotent**: committing an already-committed version returns 200 and changes nothing, so a client that retries after an ambiguous network result is safe.

For a create response with `requiresCommit: true`, upload URLs are single-use
publication staging URLs. The engine sends `If-None-Match: *`, the base64
SHA-256 ciphertext checksum, and immutable `x-amz-meta-endstate-sha256` metadata
for every PUT; the server signs all three. Commit compares the exact length and
signed metadata hash with the manifest/chunk metadata. If R2 also returns a
checksum from `HeadObject`, a mismatch is fatal, but its absence is not relied
upon for compatibility. That makes a 412 after a lost 2xx safe to treat as the
already-uploaded object, while preventing a retry from overwriting a key. A replay
after the version is committed returns the terminal replay response and never mints further PUT URLs.
Older compatibility uploads retain unsigned, checksum-free staging URLs because
their shipped engines do not send those headers; their bounded reconciliation
remains size-based.

**Client-version negotiation.** Every new version starts pending, regardless of
the `X-Endstate-API-Version` value on the request that created it. The header
only decides who completes publication:

| Client minor                | Behaviour                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `2.0`, absent, or malformed | The server's bounded reconciliation path HEAD-checks every expected encrypted object and length before publication.                                                          |
| `2.1` or newer              | The client calls the explicit commit endpoint; the server HEAD-checks every expected encrypted object, exact length, and signed ciphertext-hash metadata before publication. |

New clients MUST send `X-Endstate-API-Version` and call commit. Older callers
remain compatible but cannot make an unverified generation visible.

**Backwards compatibility.** `requiresCommit` is the create response's
durability contract. When it is `true`, the client MUST call commit and treat
**every** non-2xx result, including 404, as non-durable. A 2.0 server omits
the field (or returns `false`); the client then skips commit entirely and uses
the older create-is-durable behaviour. A 2.1 client MUST NOT probe a 2.0
commit endpoint and reinterpret its 404 as success.

**Uncommitted versions.** A version created by a 2.1 client that is never committed is reclaimed by the same scheduled cleanup job that handles retention (§8). Until then it is invisible to every user-facing surface.

### Blob storage endpoints

- `POST /api/backups/:backupId/versions/:versionId/download-urls` → request presigned download URLs for a set of chunk indices: `{ chunkIndices: [int] }` → `{ urls: [{ chunkIndex, presignedUrl, expiresAt }] }`

### Manifest URL convention (transport flag)

In the `uploadUrls` array returned by `POST /api/backups/:backupId/versions` and the `urls` array returned by `POST /api/backups/:backupId/versions/:versionId/download-urls`, the manifest blob is addressed by the sentinel `chunkIndex` value `-1`.

- Servers minting upload URLs always include the manifest URL with `chunkIndex: -1` as the first entry. Clients must PUT the encrypted manifest to that URL.
- Clients requesting download URLs MUST include `-1` in `chunkIndices` if they need the manifest. Servers return the manifest URL as `chunkIndex: -1` in the response.

This `-1` is a transport-layer flag for "this URL targets the manifest." It is unrelated to the AAD sentinel `0xFFFFFFFF` used during manifest encryption (Section 3): one is a wire-protocol convention in API responses, the other is cryptographic binding inside the encrypted blob. Implementations must treat them as independent.

### OIDC discovery

- `GET /api/.well-known/openid-configuration` (Section 9)
- `GET /api/.well-known/jwks.json` (Section 4)

### Subscription state

- `POST /api/webhooks/paddle` → Paddle webhook receiver, raw-body HMAC verification (Section 10). Not user-facing.

### Ownership enforcement

All `/api/backups/*` endpoints are scoped to the authenticated user. The server enforces ownership on every request — `userId` from the JWT must match the `userId` on the backup row. Cross-user access returns 404, not 403, to avoid leaking the existence of other users' backups.

---

## 8. Storage Layout

Cloudflare R2, EU jurisdiction.

### Bucket structure

```
users/<userId>/
  backups/<backupId>/
    versions/<versionId>/
      manifest                    # encrypted JSON (Section 3)
      chunks/<chunkIndex>         # encrypted chunk (Section 3)
```

All paths are opaque to the server. Filenames are UUIDs and integer chunk indices; no plaintext profile names appear in object keys.

### Server's role

Mints presigned URLs (PUT for upload, GET for download) scoped to a single object key with a short TTL (5 minutes). Records metadata in Postgres: `backupId`, `versionId`, `chunkIndex`, `objectKey`, `size`, `sha256`, `createdAt`. Server never reads chunk contents.

### Client's role

Uploads/downloads chunks directly to R2 via presigned URLs. Verifies SHA-256 of each chunk on download against the manifest before decrypting, and verifies the encrypted manifest blob against the `manifestSha256` returned by `GET /api/backups/:backupId/versions` before decrypting it. Refuses to decrypt any blob whose hash does not match, and writes nothing to disk in that case.

The manifest check exists for the same reason as the chunk check: without it the manifest's only integrity protection is its AEAD tag, which is evaluated after the bytes are already in the decrypt path. When the server does not advertise a `manifestSha256` for a version, the check is skipped — the gate hardens the transport where the value exists and never blocks restore against a backend that omits it.

After the last blob is stored, the client commits the version (§7). That call is what makes the generation durable.

### Versioning model (v1)

**Whole-snapshot versioning.** Each `POST /api/backups/:backupId/versions` creates a complete new copy of the backup. No chunk-level deduplication across versions. Storage cost grows linearly with version count. This is a deliberate v1 simplification; content-addressed deduplication is a possible v2 optimisation if real usage demands it.

**A version is durable only once committed (schema 2.1).** Creating a version is not the durability point — it mints a row and a set of presigned URLs, nothing more. The blobs travel client→R2 over paths the server never sees, so the server cannot know a version is complete until the client says so via `POST .../versions/:versionId/commit` (§7).

For a version created by a 2.1 client, the server therefore treats `committed_at IS NULL` as "does not exist yet":

| Surface                                                                | Uncommitted version                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/backups/:backupId/versions`                                  | Not listed                                      |
| `latestVersionId` / `versionCount` / `totalSize` on `GET /api/backups` | Not counted                                     |
| Storage quota                                                          | Not counted                                     |
| Restore target selection                                               | Never selected                                  |
| Retention pruning                                                      | Does not trigger it, and is not protected by it |

This closes a real failure mode. Before 2.1, a push that died between "create version" and "last chunk uploaded" left a row the server considered real: it was listed, it consumed quota, it pruned the oldest good generation out of retention, and a subsequent restore could select it as "latest" and fail — or worse, restore a truncated profile. The commit call moves the durability boundary to the only point at which the data is actually complete.

Versions created by every client begin pending. The server distinguishes an
explicit 2.1+ commit from bounded legacy reconciliation by the client's
advertised `X-Endstate-API-Version` minor (§7); neither path publishes before
the expected encrypted objects and lengths have been verified.

**Release-A migration bridge.** Migration 0040 records one database policy
row with a `legacy_cutoff` timestamp and `strict_generation_visibility=false`.
Only rows created before that cutoff and marked `legacy_unverified` remain
temporarily listable, downloadable, retention-eligible, and included in the
visible-usage display. Every row created after the cutoff — including an old
client's row — remains pending and invisible until verification publishes it.
An explicit R2 absence or incorrect encrypted length quarantines a historical
row immediately; it remains retained as metadata but is excluded from every
bridge predicate. Transport uncertainty remains pending and retryable.
The operator runs the bounded R2 backfill, then a guarded strict-cutover
command. The command refuses while any pre-cutoff row remains pending; strict
mode is never enabled by migration or cron. Operational order is Release A,
backfill, strict cutover, then the follow-on application release. After strict
cutover, a pre-bridge application release must not be restored.

### Versioning policy

- **Last 5 versions per backup retained.** Configurable per backup via metadata (future).
- **Retention prunes at commit, not at create.** The retention sweep for a backup runs as part of committing a new version, so the count of retained generations only ever changes when a complete, durable generation exists to replace an older one. A failed upload can no longer evict a good generation. (Under schema 2.0 semantics, where create is the durability point, pruning happens at create as before.)
- Older versions are garbage-collected by a scheduled substrate cron job.
- Garbage collection is "soft" for 7 days — version row marked `deleted_at`, blobs purged from R2 after the 7-day window — to allow for accidental-deletion recovery.
- Uncommitted versions are reclaimed by the same cron job. They were never visible, so there is no soft-delete window for them.
- After purge, blobs are unrecoverable.

### Storage quota (v1)

**1 GiB per active subscriber.** Enforced server-side at version creation.
Reservation counts every non-deleted generation, including pending uploads, so
repeated abandoned creates cannot bypass quota. The account UI reports only
visible, published usage (plus the temporary Release-A bridge history). Quota
exceeded → version creation fails with `STORAGE_QUOTA_EXCEEDED`. Calibrated
against realistic profile sizes (apps + configs typically <200 MB); intended
as a backstop against pathological cases, not a feature limit. May be raised
post-launch based on real usage data.

Because the quota check runs at create time and uncommitted versions do not count, a pathological client that creates versions it never commits is bounded by the cleanup job's cadence, not by the quota. Rate limiting at the substrate edge is the control for that case.

### Why client uses presigned URLs (not direct R2 credentials)

Direct R2 credentials in the client would mean every user can list every other user's bucket prefix. Presigned URLs scoped per-object are the standard pattern (used by AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration, Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2 documentation examples).

---

## 9. OIDC Discovery and Self-Host Contract

The substrate backend exposes standard OIDC discovery endpoints. Self-hosters running their own substrate-equivalent backend (or any OIDC-compliant issuer with appropriate endpoints) are supported without engine code changes.

### Engine configuration (two environment variables)

| Variable                   | Default (Endstate Cloud)      | Self-host example                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ENDSTATE_OIDC_ISSUER_URL` | `https://substratesystems.io` | `https://my-endstate.example.com`                                  |
| `ENDSTATE_OIDC_AUDIENCE`   | `endstate-backup`             | `endstate-backup` (or any value matching the self-hoster's issuer) |

The engine fetches `${ENDSTATE_OIDC_ISSUER_URL}/.well-known/openid-configuration` on startup, caches it for 1 hour, and uses the discovered endpoints for auth and JWKS validation.

### Required OIDC discovery fields

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://substratesystems.io",
  "jwks_uri": "https://substratesystems.io/api/.well-known/jwks.json",
  "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": ["EdDSA"],
  "endstate_extensions": {
    "auth_signup_endpoint": "https://substratesystems.io/api/auth/signup",
    "auth_login_endpoint": "https://substratesystems.io/api/auth/login",
    "auth_refresh_endpoint": "https://substratesystems.io/api/auth/refresh",
    "auth_logout_endpoint": "https://substratesystems.io/api/auth/logout",
    "auth_recover_endpoint": "https://substratesystems.io/api/auth/recover",
    "backup_api_base": "https://substratesystems.io/api/backups",
    "account_portal_url": "https://substratesystems.io/account/start",
    "supported_kdf_algorithms": ["argon2id"],
    "supported_envelope_versions": [1],
    "min_kdf_params": { "memory": 65536, "iterations": 3, "parallelism": 4 },
    "backup_api_capabilities": ["version-create-operation-replay-v1"]
  }
}
```

`account_portal_url` is optional. When absent, the engine and substrate both fall back to `${issuer}/account/start`. Self-hosters who relocate the portal (e.g. behind a separate hostname) populate this field; like `/api/account/*` and `/api/billing/*`, the portal lives off the issuer host, not under `backup_api_base`.

`backup_api_capabilities` is optional and omitted by default. The managed rollout advertises `version-create-operation-replay-v1` only when `ENDSTATE_VERSION_CREATE_OPERATION_REPLAY_V1=true`; engines must use the terminal create-replay response only after observing that capability. Servers may support the same additive capability under their own explicit rollout control.

The `endstate_extensions` block is non-standard but namespaced. Anyone implementing a self-host backend implements these extension fields. The engine refuses to talk to a backend that does not advertise them or advertises incompatible KDF / envelope minimums.

### `backup_api_base` is the source of truth for backup endpoint paths

The engine consumes `endstate_extensions.backup_api_base` as the prefix for all `/api/backups/*` calls. Self-hosters who relocate the backup API (e.g., `https://files.example.com/v1/backups`) must populate this field accordingly; the engine honors it verbatim. The field is REQUIRED — `validateDocument` rejects an empty value as `BACKEND_INCOMPATIBLE`, surfacing the misconfiguration loudly rather than silently working off the issuer-based fallback. The fallback path (`${issuer}/api/backups`) only activates when discovery itself fails (transport error, JSON parse error, full outage), preserving the engine's ability to make best-effort calls when the discovery doc is unreachable.

`/api/account/*` and `/api/.well-known/*` are NOT under `backup_api_base` — they live off the issuer host. Self-hosters who fork these need to also place them there.

### Issuer claim must match `ENDSTATE_OIDC_ISSUER_URL`

The engine validates that `discovery.issuer` matches the configured `ENDSTATE_OIDC_ISSUER_URL` after trailing-slash normalization. Mismatch returns `BACKEND_INCOMPATIBLE` with remediation pointing at the env-var disagreement (typically the substrate side hasn't been configured to advertise the right canonical URL). Both engine and substrate must read the same value into `ENDSTATE_OIDC_ISSUER_URL`.

### Storage backend

Self-hosters can use any S3-compatible object store (R2, S3, MinIO, Backblaze B2, Wasabi). The substrate backend's storage interface is documented as S3-compatible and the storage backend is configured server-side, not client-side. The engine never sees storage credentials.

### Self-host scope (v1)

- Self-hosters can run their own substrate-equivalent backend (any implementation of this contract) pointing at their own object store
- Self-hosters can swap in any OIDC-compliant issuer for auth, as long as the issuer advertises the required `endstate_extensions`
- Self-hosters configure the engine via two environment variables
- This contract document is published publicly (the protocol is open)
- Substrate's specific implementation source is not required to be public — the protocol is the spec, not the implementation
- A polished `docker-compose` self-host bundle is a v1.x deliverable, not v2.0

---

## 10. Subscription State Machine

Subscription state is authoritative on the substrate backend. The JWT carries `subscription_status` as a hint claim, refreshed each token mint (max staleness 15 minutes). Server checks the database row, not the JWT, for any write authorisation.

### States

| State       | Meaning                                             | Backup write | Backup read / restore     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| `none`      | Never subscribed, or fully cancelled past retention | Blocked      | Blocked (no data to read) |
| `active`    | Subscription paid, current                          | Allowed      | Allowed                   |
| `grace`     | Payment failed, in 30-day grace window              | Blocked      | Allowed                   |
| `cancelled` | User cancelled, in 30-day retention window          | Blocked      | Allowed                   |

### Delete operations are NOT subscription-gated

`DELETE /api/backups/:backupId` and `DELETE /api/backups/:backupId/versions/:versionId` are exempt from the write-block rule above. A signed-in user may delete their own backups in any non-`none` state. `PATCH /api/backups/:backupId` (rename) is exempt on the same basis — managing an existing backup's label is allowed in any non-`none` state, and rename is strictly less destructive than delete.

This is a deliberate kindness exception. Three reasons:

1. A user in `cancelled` is on a 30-day countdown to data purge. Forcing them to re-subscribe to delete is hostile.
2. A user in `grace` is dealing with a payment problem; the cleanup path should not require fixing billing first.
3. GDPR's user-controlled-deletion principle outweighs the storage-billing rationale that motivates blocking writes during lapse.

`none` users have no backups to delete (purge has already run), so the gate is moot for them.

### Transitions (Paddle-driven)

| Paddle event                                            | Transition                                    | Notes                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `subscription.created` (first-time)                     | `none → active`                               |                                  |
| `subscription.activated` (after grace recovery)         | `grace → active`                              | Card succeeded after past_due    |
| `subscription.past_due` (payment failed)                | `active → grace`, set `grace_started_at`      |                                  |
| `subscription.canceled` (user-initiated)                | `active → cancelled`, set `cancel_started_at` | Note Paddle spelling: "canceled" |
| `subscription.canceled` (failed payment, grace expired) | `grace → cancelled`                           |                                  |
| Internal: 30 days in `cancelled`                        | `cancelled → none`, schedule blob purge       |                                  |

### Restore-during-grace rationale

A subscription lapse is the worst time to lock users out of their own data. Card declines, expired cards, billing email going to spam — all common. Allowing read/restore during grace is the kindest UX and the one users most need at exactly the moment their card needs attention.

### Grace and retention windows (normative)

These two durations are the only time-based state transitions in the subscription machine. Both are **30 days**, and both are enforced server-side; no client enforces or displays a locally computed deadline.

| Window                 | Duration    | Starts at                                           | Ends with                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grace (payment failed) | **30 days** | `grace_started_at`, set on `subscription.past_due`  | `grace → active` on recovery, or `grace → cancelled` on expiry |
| Cancellation retention | **30 days** | `cancel_started_at`, set on `subscription.canceled` | `cancelled → none`, then blob purge                            |

Backups remain readable and restorable for the whole of both windows. Writes are blocked for the whole of both windows. Deletes and renames stay allowed throughout (see above).

A client MUST NOT hard-code either duration as an authorisation decision. The server is authoritative; `gracePeriodEndsAt` on `GET /api/account/me` is the value to surface to the user.

### Purge timeline

Blobs are purged 30 days after entering `cancelled` — the end of the cancellation retention window above. Purge is what the `cancelled → none` transition schedules:

1. Day 0: `subscription.canceled` → state `cancelled`, `cancel_started_at` set. Reads and restores continue to work; writes are blocked.
2. Days 1–30: unchanged. The user can re-subscribe at any point and keep all data.
3. Day 30: `cancelled → none`, blob purge scheduled for the user's R2 prefix.
4. After purge: all versions of all backups are unrecoverable, including any uncommitted ones.

The user's account row survives the purge. They can re-subscribe at any time and start backing up again, but data from before the purge is gone. This is documented in Terms.

### Webhook reliability

- Paddle retries webhooks on any non-2xx response
- The webhook handler is idempotent on `event_id` (Paddle's deduplication key)
- Out-of-order delivery is handled — `subscription.activated` arriving before `subscription.created` is rare but possible; the handler reconciles on `subscription_id`, not on event order

### Webhook signature verification

HMAC-SHA256 over the raw request body, using the `Paddle-Signature` header. Substrate already implements this correctly for the license webhook (`src/lib/license/paddle.ts`). The hosted-backup webhook reuses that verification utility.

---

## 11. Version Compatibility Matrix

Three independent version axes, with explicit compatibility checks at every boundary.

| Axis               | Owner     | Format                       | Source of truth             |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `apiSchemaVersion` | Substrate | `MAJOR.MINOR`                | This contract               |
| `engineVersion`    | Engine    | `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (semver) | `engine/VERSION.txt`        |
| `guiVersion`       | GUI       | `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (semver) | `endstate-gui/package.json` |

**Contract version:** Currently `2.1`. The bump from `2.0` added the version commit endpoint (§7) and the durability semantics that hang off it (§8) — additive per §13 (a new endpoint, negotiated per-client), so it is a minor bump and does not trigger the breaking-change protocol. The earlier bump from `1.0` to `2.0` was the recovery-flow shape change (see §6 and the Changelog) — a breaking auth-flow change. Changes per the rules in Section 13.

### Compatibility check at each boundary

1. **Engine ↔ Backend.** Engine fetches `/api/.well-known/openid-configuration` on startup. This compatibility release emits `X-Endstate-API-Version: 2.0` on every response, because released 2.0 engines reject a newer response schema after mutation. The backend still reads an incoming `2.1` header to select explicit commit; absent, malformed, and 2.0 callers use bounded reconciliation. The response-header bump is deferred until 2.0 clients are retired. Engine refuses to make backup-write calls if the backend's `apiSchemaVersion` major version does not match the engine's expected major. Restore (read-only) is permitted across minor mismatches but warned in logs.

   **Minor-version behaviour is asymmetric and deliberate:**

   | Engine | Backend | Reads                   | Writes                                                                                       |
   | ------ | ------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | 2.1    | 2.1     | Allowed                 | Allowed; commit required for durability                                                      |
   | 2.1    | 2.0     | Allowed                 | Allowed; create omits or returns `requiresCommit: false`, so the engine does not call commit |
   | 2.0    | 2.1     | Allowed, warned in logs | **Blocked** with `SCHEMA_INCOMPATIBLE`                                                       |

   The 2.0-engine/2.1-backend write block is the pre-existing "higher backend minor blocks writes, warns on reads" rule, and it is exactly right here: a 2.0 engine cannot commit, so its writes would be silently non-durable under 2.1 rules. The backend's per-client negotiation makes that case impossible in practice for backends that honour the advertised client minor, but the engine-side block is retained as defence in depth.

2. **GUI ↔ Engine.** Existing pattern — `endstate capabilities --json` includes `cliVersion` and `schemaVersion`. GUI checks compatibility on startup. Hosted-backup commands gated behind `engineVersion >= 2.0.0` (the version that introduces the `backup` subcommand).

3. **GUI ↔ Backend.** GUI does not talk to the backend directly. All backend calls go through the engine. The GUI's only check is "does the engine I'm bundled with support hosted backup?"

### Breaking-change protocol (post-1.0)

When `apiSchemaVersion` major bumps, the substrate backend supports the old major version for at least 90 days alongside the new major. Engines released during that window are bumped to the new major. Engines released before the bump continue working. After 90 days, old major support is dropped — engines that have not been updated will receive a clear `SCHEMA_INCOMPATIBLE` error and a remediation pointing at the auto-updater.

### Pre-1.0 / closed-beta exception

During the closed-beta period (before public 1.0 release of Hosted Backup), breaking changes to this contract are allowed without the 90-day overlap window. Any user affected during this period is consulted directly. After public 1.0 release, the breaking-change protocol above applies in full.

---

## 12. GDPR Account Deletion

A user can delete their account at any time. Deletion is hard-delete by default; no soft-delete grace. The cryptographic guarantee means any retained data is useless to us anyway, but explicit hard-delete is the principled posture.

### Endpoint

`DELETE /api/account` with the user's current access token.

### What gets deleted

- All rows in `users`, `sessions`, `subscriptions`, `backups`, `backup_versions` for the userId
- All R2 objects under `users/<userId>/`
- Active Paddle subscription cancelled

### What is retained

- An audit log entry: `{ deletedAt, userIdHash, reason: "user_request" }`. The `userIdHash` is `SHA-256(userId)`, not the original UUID — sufficient for "did this user delete?" queries from the user themselves without retaining identifying information
- Paddle's own transaction records, which Paddle retains independently per their own retention policy. Endstate cannot delete data from Paddle.

### What the user sees

Confirmation dialog with explicit warning: _"This deletes your account, your subscription, and all backed-up data. This cannot be undone."_ On confirmation, account deletion is immediate. The user is signed out. Re-signup with the same email is allowed; previous data is unrecoverable.

### Active subscription

If the user has an active subscription at deletion, the subscription is cancelled. No prorated refund — the user has chosen to delete; their billing relationship ends. This is documented in Terms.

### Timing

Account deletion is synchronous from the user's perspective (returns 200 once Postgres rows are deleted and Paddle is notified). R2 object purging is asynchronous, completes within 24 hours, scheduled job. The substrate backend marks the user's R2 prefix for deletion and a cron job runs the actual deletes.

## 13. Schema Evolution

### Additive (no schema bump)

- New optional fields in request/response shapes
- New optional manifest fields
- New error codes
- New endpoints
- New `endstate_extensions` discovery fields
- New subscription states (must default to least-permissive behaviour for older clients)

### Breaking (schema bump required)

- Field removal or rename
- Type changes
- Semantic changes to existing field meaning
- KDF parameter floor changes (e.g., raising memory minimum from 64 MiB to 128 MiB)
- Encryption envelope version changes
- Auth flow shape changes
- Subscription state semantic changes

A schema bump triggers the breaking-change protocol from Section 11.

## Changelog

- **2026-08-08 — v2.1** (additive; minor bump).
  - **§7 API surface.** New endpoint `POST /api/backups/:backupId/versions/:versionId/commit`. Idempotent; sets `committed_at` only after R2 verifies the manifest and all expected chunks. Every new generation begins pending; `X-Endstate-API-Version` selects explicit client commit (2.1+) or bounded server reconciliation (older callers). `X-Endstate-Operation-ID` is the stable create-retry identity. `X-Endstate-API-Version` is now a request header as well as a response header.
  - **§8 versioning model.** A version created by a 2.1 client is durable only once committed: until then it is not listed, not counted against quota or `versionCount`/`totalSize`, and never selected as a restore target. Retention prunes at commit rather than at create, so a failed upload can no longer evict a good generation. Uncommitted versions are reclaimed by the existing cleanup job.
  - **§8 client responsibilities.** The encrypted manifest blob is verified against the API-supplied `manifestSha256` before decryption, mirroring the existing per-chunk gate. A missing `manifestSha256` skips the check rather than failing the restore.
  - **§10 grace and retention.** Both the payment-failure grace window and the post-cancellation retention window are stated normatively as **30 days**, with the purge timeline spelled out step by step. The document already specified 30 days; substrate's implementation used 14 for grace and is being corrected to match this contract. The contract is the source of truth for the value.
  - **§11 compatibility.** Contract additions are 2.1-capable, but this release keeps `X-Endstate-API-Version: 2.0` on every response until released 2.0 engines are retired. Incoming 2.1 still selects explicit commit. The engine/backend minor matrix is stated explicitly, including the required graceful degradation of a 2.1 engine against a 2.0 backend.
  - Additive per §13 (new endpoint, negotiated per client) — no major bump, no 90-day overlap window required.
- **2026-05-27 — additive.**
  - **§4 JWT format.** New audience `endstate-account` for the GUI→web `/account` portal handoff. 60-second TTL, single-use via `jti` burn at redeem. Reuses the existing EdDSA signing infrastructure.
  - **§5 auth flow.** New endpoints `POST /api/auth/browser-session` (bearer-authenticated, engine-initiated) and `POST /api/auth/browser-session/redeem` (substrate-internal, sets HttpOnly cookie). The engine command is `endstate backup browser-session`.
  - **§7 API surface.** New endpoints `POST /api/billing/portal` (cookie-authenticated; mints Paddle customer-portal session), `POST /api/account/session/logout` (cookie-authenticated; ends `/account` web session), and `POST /api/account/web-delete` (cookie-authenticated sibling of the bearer-auth `DELETE /api/account`).
  - **§9 discovery.** New optional `endstate_extensions.account_portal_url` advertises the substrate `/account/start` URL. Fallback is `${issuer}/account/start`.
  - All additive per §13 — no schema bump.
- **2026-05-10 — v2.0** (breaking).
  - **§6 recovery flow.** Bearer-header `recoveryToken` replaces the v1.0 body-borne shape. Step 3 (`/api/auth/recover`) now returns `{ recoveryToken, recoveryKeyWrappedDEK, ttlSeconds: 600 }`. Step 7 (`/api/auth/recover/finalize`) takes `Authorization: Bearer <recoveryToken>` and a body of `{ newServerPassword, newSalt, newKdfParams, newWrappedDEK }`. Server returns `{ userId, accessToken, refreshToken, subscriptionStatus }`. Recovery tokens are single-use; replays return `RECOVERY_TOKEN_EXPIRED`.
  - **§9 self-host.** `endstate_extensions.backup_api_base` is now consumed by the engine (was advertised but ignored in v1.0). Issuer claim mismatch surfaces `BACKEND_INCOMPATIBLE` with actionable remediation about `ENDSTATE_OIDC_ISSUER_URL` agreement.
  - **§10 subscription state.** DELETE endpoints (`/api/backups/:id`, `/api/backups/:id/versions/:vid`) are exempt from the write-block rule; users may delete their own backups in any non-`none` state.
  - **§11 versioning.** `apiSchemaVersion` bumps to `2.0`. `X-Endstate-API-Version: 2.0` on every response. Engine binary semver bumps to `>=2.0.0`, aligning with the existing GUI gate language.
- **2026-05-02 — v1.0.** Initial locked release. Addendum: Section 7 documents the manifest URL convention (`chunkIndex = -1` as transport flag); Section 3 clarifies the AAD sentinel `0xFFFFFFFF` for manifest encryption is independent of the transport flag.
