-- Migration 0056 — Exomem Cloud plain-cells schema of record.
--
-- Schema of record for the shared contracts C1 (exomem_cloud_cells), C1b
-- (exomem_cloud_settings), C1c (exomem_cloud_capacity) and C1d
-- (exomem_cloud_rollout), defined in "Shared contracts with Substrate" of the
-- companion Exomem design `adopt-exomem-cloud-plain-cells`. This file must
-- match that section byte-for-byte on columns and privileges; a second copy
-- lives at Exomem's `infra/cellctl/tests/fixtures/exomem_cloud_schema.sql`
-- for cellctl's own tests. Additive only — no existing table is touched.
--
-- The repository migration runner splits on semicolons, so this migration
-- deliberately uses plain DDL plus one dollar-quoted trigger function and
-- contains no other procedural blocks.

-- touches updated_at, independent of column-level grants: a BEFORE trigger's
-- writes to NEW are not subject to the calling role's column privileges, so
-- cellctl can keep the timestamp current even though it is never granted
-- UPDATE on the column directly (see scripts/exomem-cloud-grants.sql).

-- a brand new cell row is itself a fresh desired state the controller has
-- never seen, and previously only an immediately-following UPDATE would

-- was its final one, e.g. admission's `stopped` starting state). No
-- generation bump on INSERT: the column's own DEFAULT 1 is already the
-- correct starting generation.
